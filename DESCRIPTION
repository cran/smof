Description: Starting from a given object representing a fitted model (within
  a certain set of model classes) whose linear predictor includes some ordered 
  factor(s) among the explanatory variables, a new model is constructed and
  fitted where each named factor is replaced by a single numeric score, suitably
  chosen so that the new variable produces a fit comparable with the standard
  methodology based on a set of polynomial contrasts. Reference: Azzalini (2023)
