Description: Starting from a given object representing a fitted model
  (within a certain set of model classes) whose (non-)linear predictor
  includes some ordered factor(s) among the explanatory variables, a new
  model is constructed and fitted where each named factor is replaced by a
  single numeric score, suitably chosen so that the new variable produces a
  fit comparable with the standard methodology based on a set of polynomial
  contrasts. Two variants of the present approach have been developed, one in
  each of the next references: Azzalini (2023) <doi:10.1002/sta4.624>, (2024)
  <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.15933>.
